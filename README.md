# Apple Webpage Clone

This is a project for learning purposes. This project is a clone of an old version of apple.com website.

> In this project, my goal was to improve my understanding of CSS tools and resources, such as the use of gradients and images in element backgrounds.
> I applied three different positioning techniques to the layout to achieve my goals. (Floating, Flexbox and Grid)
> In the course of the project, I improved the use of advanced CSS selectors and my code organization practices.
